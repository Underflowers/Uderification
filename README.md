## About

Underification is a microservice to help you integrate gamification features to your projects. This means that it **doesn't offer** any form of graphical interface and it should only be used to help you create your own projects.

## API endpoints

If you wish to have a documentation of the API, you can build and run the REST API. After doing the followin, the Sprint Boot server will be up and running, listening for connections on port 8080.

```bash
docker-compose up -d underification_db
cd api-impl/
mvn sprint-boot:run
```

> Note: If you aren't using the mysql container we offer, you'll have to change the configuration in [application.properties](.//api-impl/src/main/resources/application.properties).

If you're too lazy to start it up, you can find a tldr of the API documentation in our [wiki](https://github.com/Underflowers/Underification/wiki/API-Endpoints-TLDR). But know that you should be a shamed of yourself!

## Deployment

As for the main project, we've generated (this time willingly) a Docker image that contains the latest version of Underification.

```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/underflowers/underification:latest
```

Now, all you need to do is to start up a database. Once you have a database running, you need to update [/api-impl/src/main/resources/application.properties](/api-impl/src/main/resources/application.properties) with the database information needed so that Spring Boot can establish a connection with. It should look something like this:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:${MYSQL_PORT:3307}/underification?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=${MYSQL_USER:underflower}
spring.datasource.password=${MYSQL_PASSWORD:securepassword}
```

To help with this tedious task, we've created a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) which starts up a MySQL database and the REST API.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

> Note:  If you decide to use our docker-compose.yml, you'll need to updated  it with the database environment variables. Make sure that in the `application.properties` file you've set the `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql` to **underification_db** (it's the name of the service in the docker-compose.yml), otherwise it  won't work.
>
> The paths used in the docker-compose.yml are relative to the project  structure, but if you don't wont to have all of the project locally,  don't forget to update them.

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

* Java (v11.0.8)
* Git (v2.28.0)
* Docker (v19.03.12-ce)
* Docker-compose (v1.27.4)
* Maven (v3.6.3)

### Project setup

Clone the repository, then startup the database:

```bash
$ docker-composer up -d underification_db
```

Now you'll need to setup the database environment variables so the API can connect to it. Simply update it accordingly the application.properties.

> Note: You need to put the same values found in the `docker-compose.yml`.

Now you can start up Spring Boot.

```bash
$ cd api-impl/
$ mvn sprint-boot:run 
```

And voilÃ  :relieved:! You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Tests

For the tests, we're using [Cucumber.io](https://cucumber.io/). They can be found in `api-specs/` folder.

Before running the tests, you need to make sure you have a copy of `api-spec.yaml` in `api-specs/src/main/resources/`.

> Note: The file can be found in `api-impl/src/main/resources` but we've created a symlink so it should work.

Now you can run the tests

```bash
$ cd api-secs/
$ mvn test
```

> Note: The Sprint Boot server **NEEDS** to be started!
